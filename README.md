 Abstract
   
This project presents a finite element analysis (FEA) of a regular pentagon structure using Static Structural and Transient Structural simulation techniques. The material properties were derived from the student roll number (ME-1902), resulting in a Young’s Modulus of 2,000 MPa and a Poisson’s Ratio of 0.28.
The static analysis utilized a load of 2,020 N (calculated from the date of birth), while the transient simulation applied a time-dependent load of 281.5 N (based on the USD to PKR exchange rate). One face of the pentagon was fixed, and a remote force was applied at one-third of the face length. The analysis compares the deformation and stress results between the static equilibrium and the time-dependent transient response.

Introduction

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is a numerical method used to predict how a part behaves under physical conditions. In this project, a regular pentagon geometry was analyzed under two distinct conditions:
	Static Structural: Assumes the load is applied slowly, ignoring inertial and damping effects.
Transient Structural: Analyzes the dynamic response of the structure over a defined time period (time-dependent), considering inertia and damping.
The goal is to observe how the pentagon deforms when a remote force is applied at a specific offset location on the fixed face.
 the Transient Structural simulation visualized the system's behavior under a lighter, time-stepped load (USD Rate derived). The use of a Remote Force at 1/3rd distance introduced realistic moment effects on the fixed face.
